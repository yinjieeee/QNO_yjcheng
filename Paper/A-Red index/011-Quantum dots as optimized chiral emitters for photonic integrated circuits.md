#### Abstract
Chiral coupling, which allows directional interactions between quantum dots (QDs) and photonic crystal waveguide modes, holds promise for enhancing the functionality of quantum photonic integrated circuits. Elliptical polarizations of QD transitions already offer a considerable enhancement in directionality. However, in epitaxial QD fabrication, the lack of precise control over lateral QD positions still poses a challenge in achieving efficient chiral interfaces. Here, we present a theoretical analysis in which we propose to optimize the polarization of a QD emitter against the spatially averaged directionality and demonstrate that the resulting emitter offers a considerable technological advantage in terms of the size and location of high-directionality areas of the waveguide as well as their overlap with the regions of large Purcell enhancement, thereby improving the scalability of the device. Moreover, using $ùíå¬∑ùíë$ modeling, we demonstrate that the optimal elliptical polarization can be achieved for neutral exciton transitions in a realistic QD structure. Our results present a viable path for efficient chiral coupling in QD-based photonic integrated circuits, to a large extent overcoming the challenges and limitations of the present manufacturing technology.
