>Linear optics was believed to be insuffcient for quantum computation because every implementable evolution can be understood in terms of a small unitary matrix, contrary to expectations of exponential complexity. Furthermore, passive linear optics does not involve particle interactions other than those imposed by statistics and can be understood in terms of classical wave mechanics. There is, however, a hidden non-linearity in LOQC (in the photo-detectors) and our techniques effectively transfer this non-linearity to the bosonic qubits, thus enabling universal quantum computation.
>There are other options for implementing LOQC. Particularly interesting is an idea that involves encoding qubits in the phase space of a mode. Universal computation in this system requires active linear optics and a nonlinearly prepared state, but has the advantage of being intrinsically robust against errors involving shifts in the canonically conjugate variables. It may be possible to combine approaches to achieve robust and effcient LOQC even more easily.
