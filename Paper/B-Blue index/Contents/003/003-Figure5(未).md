>FIG. 5. (a) Plot of $1-F_{11}$ for second-order nonlinearity as a function of storage time. Gray corresponds to$\gamma_L/\Omega_G=0$ and it increases from $10^{−5}$ (blue) to $2\cdot10^{−3}$ (red). Dashed lines with the same color plot the corresponding values of the error in conditional fidelity, $1-\overline{F}_{11}$. (b) Plot of the minimum error as a function of $\chi_k/\gamma_L$ corresponding to the circles in Fig. 4(a) (k ¼ 3, red) and Fig. 5(a) (k ¼ 2, blue). Dashed lines plot the corresponding values of the conditional fidelity. The slope of all curves are −1, demonstrating the relationship $1-F_{11}=C^{(k)}\gamma_L/\chi_k$, where $C^{(2)}=5.5$ and $C^{(2)}=18.7$. Note that (a) and (b) share the y axis.
