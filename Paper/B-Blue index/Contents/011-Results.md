#### #### Waveguide modes （pp.4–5）

Using the finite-element method, we first determine the photonic TE-like bands, shown in Fig. 2(a), and the corresponding group indices [Fig. 2(b)] for the photonic crystal waveguide. The defect modes are plotted with lines, whereas the extended modes in the photonic crystal and the extended modes propagating in the air (radiation modes) are represented as dark- and light-gray-shaded areas, respectively. We see that the chosen structure supports one well-confined mode plotted with a solid line. In addition, there are three modes near the bulk modes (dashed) that are anticipated to leak into the continuum in practice. The favorable guided mode spans a wide frequency range, offering a good spectral adjustment to the QD transition. In addition, it is a well-confined mode and, therefore, selected for further consideration.

Next, we calculate the polarization properties of the selected mode and extract the polarization parameters as described in the Appendix. We show the ellipticity angle χf in the z = 0 plane as a function of position in Fig. 3(a) and the orientation angle Ψf in Fig. 3(b). We can clearly see in Fig. 3(a) that each of the two helicities (right-handed in green and left-handed in purple) appears almost exclusively in one half of the waveguide. While the white line in the plot indicates linear polarization, the very dark spots, highlighted by the red crosses, mark circular polarization (C points). Apart from these tiny regions, part of which lie close to the air holes, the selected mode shows predominantly elliptical polarization&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

#### #### Emitter coupling （pp.5–6）

We now consider a QD emitter coupled to the electric field of the selected guided mode. In the first step, we treat the emitter formally, characterizing its polarization by the orientation and ellipticity angles (Ψd, χd). For every polarization state of the dipole transition moment, we calculate the directionality from Eq. (6) at a given point in the structure. As previously shown [49], with an appropriately polarized emitter, perfect directionality can be reached at a given position. However, in view of the random placement of the QD, a more informative figure of merit appears to be the directionality averaged over the QD position. Therefore, we average the result over half the core region [blue shaded region in Fig. 1(b)], as discussed above.

Figure 4 presents the average directionality of the QD emission for different polarization states of the dipole transition moment of the QD for ka/(2π) = 0.31 [ng ≈ 4.4]. The maximal average directionality |D̄| ≈ 0.58 is achieved for Ψd = 0 and χd = ∓0.178π. We observe that even modest deviations from these parameters lead to significant drops in average directionality. The average directionality decays for increasing group index values, showing that high ng comes at the cost of more backscattering and reduced performance.

We further compare the spatial maps of directionality and Purcell factor for optimized elliptical vs circular polarization (Fig. 6). The high-directionality area for elliptical polarization is about four times larger than that for circular dipoles. Importantly, the Purcell-enhanced regions largely overlap with the high-directionality regions, and these zones avoid the edges of the air holes, which is beneficial for fabrication compatibility and optical quality&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

本研究從電磁模態與偶極極化兩方面，驗證在實際光子晶體波導（PCW）中設計橢圓偏振的量子點能有效提升方向性耦合效率。模擬指出在最佳化橢圓極化下，方向性可達 ±0.58，且有效方向性區域相較於圓極化擴大近四倍，並與 Purcell 增強區域顯著重疊，提升光子發射效率與耦合穩定性。使用 k·p 建模亦證明中性激子於弱磁場下即可達成所需極化條件。此方法克服了現有技術中難以精確定位 QD 的瓶頸，為實現可擴展的手性耦合 PIC 奠定基礎。
