**Figure 4 |**
- **(a)** Population dynamics of the QE pair within the TO cavity in [[017-Figure3|Fig. 3]](b) under even coherent driving and initially in their ground state, $n_G(0) = 1$. The transients obtained from Eqs. (1) and (5) are rendered in color solid and black dotted lines, respectively. Vertical gray lines indicate the preparation times of the TO steady state, τ, and the phenomenological pure dark state, $τ_{DS}$.
- **(b)** and **(c)** show the spectral density at the emitters position (yellow, purple) and the cross-spectral density (light blue). Dotted lines render their single-mode fitting at the laser frequency (vertical line).
