**Figure 1 | TO-designed nanophotonic cavity, of radius R and height h, hosting a QE pair.**
 - The emitters are aligned and oriented along the z-direction, and driven coherently by laser fields of amplitude $Ω_i$ (wavy green lines). 
 - The light gray mesh renders the spatial discretization in the solution of Maxwell’s equations, and the permittivity map is coded from white (vacuum) to black ($ϵ = ϵ_{max}$).
 - The bottom-right illustrates the spectral position and Lorentzian-type line shapes of the QEs, with their linewidths and detunings with respect to the laser frequency $ω_L$.
