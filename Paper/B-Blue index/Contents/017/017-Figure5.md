- **(a)** Permittivity map for the inverse-designed cavity max-imizing the fidelity to the W state in Eq. (6) for an inter-emitter distance $d = 1.17Î»$, and the same dimensions as the device in [[017-Figure3|Fig. 3]](b). The dielectric constant is coded in white-to-black linear scale. The position and orientation of the emitters along the $z$-direction is indicated by red and blue arrows. 
-  **(b)** Quantum tomography of the steady-state density matrix (real part) for a QE triple in the cavity in panel **(a)**. Only the entries within the ground and single-excitation manifolds are shown. The colors represent the absolute value of the real part of the density matrix in logarithmic scale. Inset shows the difference between the TO density matrix and a phenomenological one, resulting from the direct PSO of the master equation parameters maximizing $F_{+++}$ (same color scale as in the main panel).
