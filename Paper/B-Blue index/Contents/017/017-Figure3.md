 - **(a)** Fidelity, normalized coupling strengths, and Purcell factor versus iteration step for the TO cavity targeting the odd Bell state for $d_{12} = 3.4Î»$.
- **(b)** Permittivity map obtained as a result of the TO procedure in panel (a). The dielectric constant is represented in gray scale between 1 (white) and 5 (black). The red and blue arrows indicate the position and orientation of the QEs.
