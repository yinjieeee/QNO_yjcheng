 - **(a)** Fidelity to even and odd Bell states, F+±, versus inter-emitter distance for TO cavities with $R =6.25λ$ and $h = 16.67λ$. Purity, $F_{+±}$, and ground state population, $n_G^{+±}$, of the attained states. The detuning and pumping parameters are $|δ_i |/γ_0 = 0.2$ and $|Ω_i|/γ_0 = 0.7$.
- **(b)** Dissipative, $γ_{12}$, and coherent, $g_{12}$, coupling strengths normalized to the QEs decay rate, $γ =\sqrt{γ_1γ_2}$, as a function of $d_{12}$ for same devices as panel (a). 
- **(c)** Purcell factor, $γ/γ_0$, versus emitter–emitter distance for all the cases above. The blue arrow indicates the configuration considered in [[017-Figure3|Figs. 3]]  and [[017-Figure4|4]].
