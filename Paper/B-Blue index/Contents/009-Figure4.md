**Figure 4 | Examples of chiral light–matter interaction in photonic nanostructures.**
- **a,** Directional spontaneous emission of two opposite circularly ($σ_±$) polarized dipoles into opposite directions of a glide-plane photonic-crystal waveguide. The plot illustrates the spatial distribution  of the emitted intensity$| E|^2$  with the colour scale indicating the strength.
- **b,** Direction-dependent coupling between a single resonator-enhanced atom and nanofibre-guided light. The atom couples strongly to forward-propagating light (blue curve), as is evident from the observed Rabi splitting in the transmission spectrum when scattering light off the atom. In contrast, the atom is only weakly coupled to the backward-propagating light, leading to the usual Lorentzian transmission spectrum (red curve). The insets illustrate the geometry of the set-up. Data from  ref. [20] with error bars indicating the 1$σ$ statistical error. Image in **a** adapted from ref. [27], Nature Publishing Group.
