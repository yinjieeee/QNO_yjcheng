>The fabrication recipe is based only on standard semiconductor microfabrication techniques and is similar to the one reportedin Ref. [10] for microring resonators in single crystal diamond. A200nm thick diamond membrane was obtained by thinning a 5um thick type IIa single-crystal diamond membrane (**Element Six, <1ppm nitrogen, orientation of the top face is 110**) using reactive ion etching (RIE) in an **oxygen plasma**. Prior to the etching process, the membrane was mounted on a Si substrate. After the membrane preparation, a silicon nitride (100 nm) layer was deposited on top, and the photonic crystal device was patterned in this layer using electron-beam lithography and RIE. Two more etching steps were used to transfer the pattern from silicon nitride to diamond and then remove the excess silicon nitride. Finally, an isotropic dry etch removed the Si under the photonic crystal, and the membrane at the device location was left suspended [see Figs. 1(b)–1(d)].
