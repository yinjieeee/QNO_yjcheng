>In conclusion, we have demonstrated coupling of the zero-phonon line of a single NV center to a photonic crystal cavity fabricated in single-crystal diamond. 
>The spontaneous emission into the ZPL is enhanced by a factor of  70, which corresponds to 70% of the photons being emitted in the ZPL and into the cavity mode. The photonic crystal platform allows for the possibility to dramatically improve these results with better designs (Q> $10^6$ is theo-retically possible [11]) and improved fabrication techniques. For example, with a mode volume of $1(\frac{\lambda}{n})^3$ and a quality factor of $10^5$, the system can operate at the onset of strong coupling regime, with more than 99% of the emission into the ZPL. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we determined that the NV centers in this material have a single-scan linewidth of a few GHz and a spectral diffusion under 532 nm of several GHz, which is not surprising for diamond of this quality (nitrogen concentra-tion <1ppm). However, the measured linewidth is two orders of magnitude larger than the natural linewidth of NV centers, a serious issue for quantum information applications, where linewidths smaller than the ground state spin triplet splitting of 2.87 GHz are generally needed. For sensing applications, enhancing the emission into the ZPL increases the overall signal, thus enhancing the sensitivity. However, the requirement to cool the device limits the range of applications. Current and future effort is focused on fabricating similar devices in diamond material with much lower native nitrogen concentration (< 5 ppb), where the measured linewidth is much closer to the natural linewidth [26]. If such spectral stability can be maintained in micro-fabricated structures, the resulting devices should enable efficient implementation of remote entanglement between NV centers via photon interference. In parallel, significant effort is dedicated toward integrating these cavities with electrodes used to stabilize the NV frequency against spec-tral diffusion [27] and toward the development of complex photonic networks as needed for quantum-information devices for quantum chemistry [28] and factoring [29].
