**Figure 6 | Applications of chiral light–matter interaction.**
- **a,** Layout of an optical circulator for single photons based on non-reciprocal phase shift in a Mach–Zehnder interferometer containing a glide-plane waveguide with a quantum emitter. Upper image, an input single photon (blue wavepacket) in the lower waveguide scattering off a chirally coupled emitter acquires a $π$ phaseshift whereby it exits via the lower waveguide as well. Lower image, in the reverse situation the photon does not interact with the emitter and therefore exits via the upper waveguide. 
- **b,** The chiral interaction in a  $Λ$ -type system can be used to realize a single-photon-controlled optical switch. The transmitted field and the forward-scattered field (blue arrows) are in phase opposition and therefore interfere destructively. As a consequence, the resulting forward-propagating power vanishes and an incoming photon is fully back-scattered. In the back-scattering process, the atom is switched from state $α$ to state $β$ . 
- **c,** Illustration of atoms  (blue circles) scattering guided light in a nanofibre with direction-dependent rates, leading to the realization of an optical diode. The green and blue circular arrows indicate the polarization of the initially linearly polarized light (green and blue straight vertical arrows) in the evanescent field of the nanofibre for light propagating in $+ z$ and $–z$ direction, respectively.
