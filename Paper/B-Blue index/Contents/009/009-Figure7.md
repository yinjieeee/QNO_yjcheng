**Figure 7 | Multi-emitter chiral coupling and dynamics.**
- **a,** Illustration of two one-dimensional emitters unidirectionally coupled by a photonic waveguide. The photons from emitter 1 (left) propagate to emitter 2 (right), but not vice versa.
 - **b,** Level scheme illustrating the collective states of the two emitters in a basis of triplet states $| g_1, g_2〉$ , $| T〉  ∝  | e_1, g_2〉  +  | g_1, e_2〉$  and $| e_1, e_2〉$ , and singlet state $| S〉  ∝  | e_1, g_2〉  −  | g_1, e_2〉$ , including their decay channels. For symmetric coupling $| S〉$  and $| T〉$  are decoupled subradiant and superradiant states, but chiral coupling leads to a mutual coupling (horizontal arrow).
