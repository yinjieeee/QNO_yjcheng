**Figure 2 | Electric field polarization and spin in optical nanofibres and waveguides.** 
- **a,** Colour map of the field intensity of a vacuum-clad optical nanofibre. The local polarization is represented by blue, red and black arrows to indicate the two circular in-plane polarizations (blue and red) and linear polarization (black). The radius of the **fibre is 250 nm**, its **refractive index is 1.45** and the propagation direction is along $+ z$ at a **wavelength of 852 nm**. 
- **b,**Â Colour map of the electric spin density | $\textbf{S}_\varepsilon$|  in the cross-sectional plane of the nanofibre, with arrows indicating the spin direction. 
- **c,** Colour map of the field intensity and local polarization of a photonic-crystal glide-plane waveguide[27]. The grey arrow shows the propagation direction. In all panels, the linear colour scale ranges from zero (dark colours) to maximum (light colours). The **lattice constant is 240 nm**, the membrane thickness is 160 nm, the **wavelength is 911 nm** and the membrane **refractive index 3.46**.
