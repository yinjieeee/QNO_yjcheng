**Figure 1 | Illustration of basic chiral photon–emitter processes.**  
- **a,** Directional photon emission in a waveguide controlled by the polarization of the <font color="#ffc000">dipole emitter</font>, $σ_+$ or $σ_−$. The quantization axis is along the y axis. Inset, an emitter level scheme with two orthogonally circularly polarized transitions. 
- **b,** Non-reciprocal phase shift of $π$  imprinted on a forward-propagating photon (top) while a backward-propagating photon does not interact with the emitter (bottom). 
- **c,** Non-reciprocal absorption, whereby the scattering of light from the waveguide into non-guided modes is direction-dependent. 
- **d,** Chiral light–matter interaction in a waveguide leading to directional coupling between multiple emitters. In all panels, the coloured arrows (blue and red) illustrate the local in-plane (circular) polarization of the electric field of the waveguide mode for the propagation direction indicated by the black arrows.
