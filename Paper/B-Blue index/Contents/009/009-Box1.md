**Confined light and transverse photon spin**

The confinement of light transversely to the propagation direction naturally leads to a longitudinal field component. As a demonstration, consider a focused light beam of wavelength $λ =  2π /k$, where $k$ is the wave number, and $ω$ the angular frequency that propagates along $± z$. The electric field is $$E_\pm(\textbf{r},t)=\frac{\varepsilon_{\pm}(\textbf{r})}{2}e^{-i(\omega{t}\mp{kz})}+c.c.$$, where
- $\varepsilon\pm$ is the complex amplitude
- $r$ is the position vector
- $t$ is time
- $c.c.$ denotes the complex conjugate

Assuming a slowly varying amplitude along z($\frac{\partial{\varepsilon_{\pm,z}}}{\partial_z}<<k\varepsilon$) and applying Gauss’ law leads to[[009-Box1 Appendix|註]]
$$\varepsilon_{\pm,z}=\mp\frac{i}{k}(\frac{\partial{\varepsilon_{\pm,x}}}{\partial_x}+\frac{\partial{\varepsilon_{\pm,y}}}{\partial_y})$$
Consequently, the longitudinal ($\varepsilon_{\pm,z}$) and transverse ($\varepsilon_{\pm,x}$ and $\varepsilon_{\pm,y}$) components are comparable only when the latter vary substantially over a length of $1/k =  λ/(2π )$. The $∓π/2$ phase of $\varepsilon_{\pm,z}$ implies that even a **linearly polarized beam becomes elliptically** polarized in the strongly focused region and that the sense of rotation of $\textbf{E}$ depends on the direction of propagation, $± z$. The same line of reasoning applies to the magnetic field.

The spin angular momentum density of the electric field is $\textbf{S}_\varepsilon=-[\frac{i\epsilon_0}{(2\omega)}]\varepsilon^*\times\varepsilon$ [88], where $ε_0$ is the vacuum permittivity. The presence of $\varepsilon_{±,z}$ leads to a transverse spin component in the $x–y$ plane that flips sign when the propagation direction is reversed[8–10]. This inherent link between the sign of the transverse spin and the propagation  direction — known as spin–momentum locking[89] — is a consequence of the time-reversal symmetry of Maxwell’s equations. *Box 1 Figure* illustrates the emergence of transverse spin for the simple case of total internal reflection at a dielectric interface[88].

**Box 1 Figure | Total internal reflection of a linearly p-polarized wave at a dielectric interface.**  The dielectric interface has refractive indices $n_1>n_2$. The evanescent field in the upper medium features propagation- direction-dependent transverse spin. $θ$ indicates the input angle of a ray at the interface, and above a certain critical angle the mode becomes **evanescent** in medium 2.
