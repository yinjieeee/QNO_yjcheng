>Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond represent one of the best test beds for future quantum photonic technologies, due to their outstanding properties as spin qubits that can be coupled to optical photons. 
>Applications include quantum information and electromagnetic field sensing. For quantum information applications, multiple NV centers need to be interconnected. 
>One approach relies on integrating NVs in photonic networks, where large-scale entanglement between NV centers is created using interference of identical photons at the zero-phonon line (ZPL) frequency. However, in bulk diamond the ZPL transition accounts for only a few percent of the NVemission. Here we report 70-fold enhancement of the transition rate through the ZPL for a single NV coupled to a photonic crystal cavity in monocrystalline diamond. These cavities are fabricated using scalable semiconductor fabrication techniques and can be further coupled into photonic networks.
