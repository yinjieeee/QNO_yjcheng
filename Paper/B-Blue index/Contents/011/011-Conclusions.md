We have studied the possibility of using a QD emitter for enhancing the chiral coupling to a guided light mode in a glide-plane waveguide. We choose the spatially averaged directionality as our figure of merit. We show that an emitter optimized in this way, apart from maximizing the overall chiral coupling, shows favorable properties from the point of view of structure manufacturing: It enhances the area of the waveguide core where the directionality is high as compared to circularly polarized emitters and offers improved overlap between regions of high directionality and large Purcell enhancement [49].

Using the kÂ·p method, we have further demonstrated that optimal polarization properties can be achieved within realistic compositional and morphological characteristics of QDs by exploiting neutral exciton transitions at weak magnetic fields.

Thus, the use of appropriately designed QDs for elliptically polarized emission is a potential path to improved scalability for quantum information processing and communication devices based on chiral interfaces, partly overcoming the challenges posed by the lack of precise control over lateral QD positions in epitaxial QD fabrication, which has hindered the achievement of efficient chiral interfaces for realistic QD ensembles so far. This finding presents an important step towards achieving robust chiral coupling in QDs-based photonic integrated circuits&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
