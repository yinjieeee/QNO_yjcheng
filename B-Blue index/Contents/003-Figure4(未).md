>FIG. 4. (a) Plot of $1-F_{11}$ for a $\chi^{(3)}$ material as a function of storage time, T, for different loss rates. Gray corresponds to $\gamma_L/\Omega_G=0$ and it increases from $4\cdot{10}^{-7}$ (blue) to $10^{−3}$ (red). Dashed lines with the same color plot the corresponding values of the error in conditional fidelity, $1-\overline{F}_{11}$. (b) Plot of $1-F_{11}$ as a function of the intrinsic quality factor, $Q_L$, corresponding to the vertical cross sections in (a). The legend shows the limiting values of the conditional fidelity, $1-\overline{F}_{11}$. 
>Parameters：$\gamma/\Omega_G=30$；$\chi^{(3)}=1.8\cdot{10}^{-19}m^2/V^2$；$\lambda=1550nm$；$\overline{n}=3.4$；$V^{(3)}_m=10^{-3}(\lambda/\overline{n})^3$
