**Figure 3 | Nanophotonic devices used for chiral coupling between light and quantum emitters.** 
- **a,** Optical nanofibre with an array of cold atoms (yellow circles) trapped in the evanescent field surrounding the fibre.  A left-handed circularly polarized laser beam (vertical green arrow) excites the atoms. The fluorescence light that the atoms emit into the nanofibre propagates almost exclusively in the $â€“z$-direction (horizontal green arrow). 
- **b, c,** Whispering-gallery-mode microresonators that confine light via total internal reflection and provide strong coupling to a single rubidium atom. 
- **d,** Cross of two nanowire planar waveguides with guided modes coupled to a quantum dot placed in the crossing region. Two out-coupling gratings at the end of the waveguides are used to couple light vertically off the photonic chip. 
- **e,** Two-dimensional photonic-crystal membrane with an introduced waveguide obtained by leaving out a row of holes of the photonic lattice. A single layer of quantum dots is embedded in the centre of the membrane (indicated as yellow triangles in the inset). The inset shows a close-up of the photonic crystal lattice.
