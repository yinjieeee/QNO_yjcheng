>In the studies so far, the Purcell effect was not considered explicitly during OLED optical simulations, potentially yielding misleading results in the performance estimation and device design of OLEDs. In this work, we demonstrated the importance of the Purcell factor by varying the OLED device structures. Results show that Purcell effect is significant in OLEDs in which high radiative quantum efficiency emissive materials are used. In such materials, the effective exciton lifetime and decay rate are strongly influenced by the Purcell factor. To verify the technical significance of Purcell factors experimentally, we fabricated actual BEOLEDs and TEOLEDs with various structures. In the case of TEOLEDs with a strong resonance structure, overestimation was avoided and more accurate optical simulation results were obtained by considering the Purcell factor. The results also show that the efficiency and angular emission spectra of the OLEDs were estimated accurately. From practical viewpoints, because many mobile AM-OLED gadgets use TEOLEDs, we believe our approach can serve as a useful guide to design efficient and angular stable EL spectra TEOLEDs.

|        | 對於高輻射量子效率的OLED而言，Purcell effect是相當重要的效應(影響細節分布)，強烈影響著有效激子壽命和衰減率                |
| 證實     | Purcell Factor的重要性，以此勸導後續研究上要對於此效應留心                                           |
| 證實上述證實 | 使用BEOLED和TEOLED驗證，對於強共振結構及市場普及(例：移動AM-OLED設備)的TEOLED，Purcell effect影響更大，更需要被考慮 |
