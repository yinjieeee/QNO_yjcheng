**Master equation for a cascaded quantum system**

If many independent one-dimensional emitters are coupled to a waveguide, then the photons can mediate collective effects. To describe the quantum state of the emitters, the photons can be eliminated and the dynamics of the reduced state of the emitters $ρ$ is described by a master equation. For two emitters (labelled 1 and 2) with ideal unidirectional coupling ($β_+ =  1$ and $β_− =  0$), this method leads to the simplest form of a master equation for a <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">ca†scaded system</mark>[11,12]：
$$\dot{\rho}=-i(H_{eff}\rho-{\rho}H_{eff}^\dagger)+\sigma\rho\sigma^\dagger$$
The non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian associated with an evolution without quantum jumps is
$$H_{eff}=H_{sys}-i\frac{\gamma_+}{2}(\sigma_1^+\sigma_1^-+\sigma_2^+\sigma_2^-+2\sigma_2^+\sigma_1^-)$$
It contains the bare Hamiltonians of the two individual emitters, $H_sys=  H_1+  H_2$, and non-Hermitian terms that describe the decay of the excited states. The last term in equation (2) is unique to the cascaded setting and breaks the symmetry between the emitters: it describes the process by which emitter 1 radiates a photon that is then absorbed by emitter 2. The last term in equation (1) is associated with quantum jumps that correspond to the detection of a photon at the output port of the waveguide, and the collective jump operator is σ =+σσ12−− as the sum of lowering operators of the two-level atoms. The unidirectional flow of information is implicit within the master equation (equation (1)), as can be seen explicitly by calculating the equation of motion of the reduced states of the two individual emitters, ρi≡  tri {ρ} (i =  1, 2), tracing over the degrees of freedom not belonging to subsystem i. Whereas the equation for ρ1 is closed and independent of the state of the second atom, the reverse is not true. The cascaded master equation can be generalized to include many emitters72 and to the case of arbitrary  β+ and β− (refs 73,74).
