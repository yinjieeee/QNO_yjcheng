>Our mapping of the phase space governing the collapse of suspended platforms provides a clear design rule both for new research aiming to exploit the deterministic self-assembly and for conventional micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems, where collapses are generally undesirable. 
>The ubiquitous nature of surface forces implies that our concepts can be applied to any material, which may even be coated with ultra-thin functional materials, for example, using atomic-layer deposition, which would then be embedded in ultra-compact devices. 
>Our demonstration of optical cavities with few- to sub-nanometre features therefore takes the first steps towards a new generation of integrated nanophotonic devices exhibiting extreme field intensities that may approach both the limits to light–matter interaction trength and regimes where the continuum model of electromagnetism breaks down. 
>Such levels of confinement may impact a wide span of potential applications such as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, biosensing and quantum technologies. For example, our self-assembled waveguide-coupled cavity features an unprecedented set of arameters: with a mode volume of $8.8\times10^{-4}$ cubic wavelengths and a loaded Q-factor of $1.4\times10^{4}$, the light–matter  interaction is enhanced by a Purcell factor of $1.3\times10^{6}$ with a wide bandwidth and a high on-resonance transmission. 
>By incorporating embedded emitters such as erbium-doped alumina, highly efficient single-photon sources at telecom wavelengths may be envisioned, possibly even with a high degree of quantum coherence due to the extreme Purcell enhancements. Such cavities may also enhance the bulk nonlinearity of embedded materials to a level where they could operate using single photons and provide record single-photon optomechanical readout rates for gigahertz mechanical modes even in the absence of embedded materials. 
>While our work showcases the self-assembly of photonic cavities with few- to sub-nanometre confinement, our method may be applied in a much broader field of research and technology, for example, solid-state nanopore sequenc-ing, nanogap quantum tunnelling electrodes or ultra-high-quality shadow masks for superconducting quantum electronic devices. More generally, our work opens perspectives for exploring new regimes of photonics, electronics and mechanics at atomic scales while at the same time enabling scalable and self-aligned integration with large-scale chip architectures.
