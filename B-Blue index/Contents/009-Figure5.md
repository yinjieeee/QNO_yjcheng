**Figure 5 | Photon–emitter scattering for symmetric and chiral coupling.**
**a–d,** Illustration of the case of $β\ll 1 (a, b)$ and of deterministic coupling ($β =  1; c, d$), for symmetric coupling (**a, c**) and chiral coupling (**b, d**), comparing forward (top in each panel) and backward (bottom in each panel) propagation. The different effects are elaborated in the main text. The pictorial representations are identical to those introduced in [[009-Figure1]] with the addition of the special case of a linear polarization (pink arrows).
