> ContentsThe ultimate vision of this project is to deploy a novel quantum emitter, the tin-vacancy (SnV) centre in diamond, for the generation of photonic cluster states. Such states are the fundamental requirement for a novel, "all-photonic" quantum repeater, which will in future provide a route for the implementation of scalable quantum networks.
	SnV是近期研究量子發射器的一個基底，可以產生光子簇態(photonics cluster states)，以此提供發射器新的樣貌 全光子量子中繼器(all-photonics quantum repeater)'，擴展量子網路的發展方向。

> [!paragraph]
> Two of the most mature systems that enable the entanglement of spin qubits and coherent photons are quantum dots and the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in diamond.  
> However, between these two systems, NVs exhibit excellent coherence times exceeding 1s, but lack efficient emission into the zero-phonon line (ZPL) required to yield indistinguishable photons, whereas quantum dots have shown great promise in emission properties but are limited to tens ns coherence times. 
> This highlights the typical challenges working with solid-state quantum emitters: 
> (i) single photon production;
> (ii) the emitter spin coherence times. Recent investigations into group IV vacancy centres in diamond show promise in meeting these desiderata.
	量子發射器需要系統具備'自旋量子位元和相干光子'糾纏(the entanglement of spin qubits and coherent photons)的特性
	(1) NV centre coherence time>1s
	(2) quantum dot good emmision properties
	兩個重要特性，兩種技術各占一個，凸顯量子發射器兩大挑戰：(1) 單光子產生 (2) 發射器自旋相干時間
	現研究出4族元素可以解決這問題(C、Si、Ge、Sn...)

>[!paragraph]
>Group IV vacancy centres in diamond show excellent optical properties due to their crystallographic symmetry which favours emission into ZPL. The most explored defect of this group, the SiV, has demonstrated T2 spin coherence times exceeding 10 ms, but requires operation at 100mK temperatures to suppress detrimental coupling to phononic environment [1].  Based upon investigations into SiV there has been recently growing interest in investigating other, heavier, group IV colour centres since these offer the prospect of improved performance. Particularly promising is the SnV [2.3]. in which coherence times on the order tens of milliseconds are anticipated, but not yet shown: the 10ms coherence times of the SiV at 100mK is predicted to be matched by the SnV at 2K – a readily accessible temperature with standard helium cryostats.
	4族晶格對稱的特性利於ZPL發射，目前SiV研究出其需超低溫操作溫度(~100mK)，以抑制phonon跟環境耦合，降低量子發射器效率。
	另得，原子數較大的4族元素受到重視，目前以SnV為主，使用準氦氣低溫器實現操作溫度2K，預計可以達到10 ms相干時間。

>Our investigation focusses on characterising, controlling and utilising the SnV for quantum communication protocols.  In doing so, build up the necessary knowledge base, and explore and demonstrate the fundamental tools for exploiting this yet unexplored - but promising - system, as a candidate platform for quantum technologies. This begins with emitter characterisation, the development of optical coherent manipulation techniques, and a measurement of the coherence time of ground state electron spin at 4K. With well-characterized, suitable, emitters, this lays the foundations for the generation and verification of spin-photon entanglement – the fundamental capability required of a quantum node.
